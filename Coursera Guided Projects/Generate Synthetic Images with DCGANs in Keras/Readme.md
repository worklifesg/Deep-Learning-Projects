## Guidelines
In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

    Understand Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs and GANs)
    Design and train DCGANs using the Keras API in Python

By the end of this course, you will be able to build and train a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) with Keras to generate images of fashionable clothes.

## Tasks
```
    Task 1: Project Overview and Import Libraries
    Task 2: Load and Preprocess the Fashion MNIST Data
    Task 3: Create Batches of Shuffled Training Data
    Task 4: Build the Generator Network for DCGAN
    Task 5: Build the Discriminator Network for DCGAN
    Task 6: Compile the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)
    Task 7: Define the Training Procedure
    Task 8: Train DCGAN
    Task 9: Generate Synthetic Images with DCGAN
```
## Code Instructions
In this project, we have analyzed 2 programs:
  * Version 1 - Generator and Discriminator models of 128 x 128 Gray Scale Image with epochs = 10 (Average Quality)
  * Version 2 - Generator and Discriminator models of 256 x 256 Gray Scale Image with epochs = 100 (Improved Quality)
