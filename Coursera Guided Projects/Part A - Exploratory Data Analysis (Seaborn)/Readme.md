## Project
Part A - Exploratory Data Analysis (Seaborn) 

## Guidelines
In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

    Produce data visualizations with Seaborn.
    Apply graphical techniques used in exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    
## Tasks
            Task 1: Introduction and Importing the Data
            Task 2: Separate Target from Features
            Task 3: Diagnosis Distribution Visualization
            Task 4: Visualizing Standardized Data with Seaborn
            Task 5: Violin Plots and Box Plots
            Task 6: Using Joint Plots for Feature Comparison 
            Task 7: Observing the Distribution of Values and their Variance with Swarm Plots
            Task 8: Observing all Pairwise Correlations
