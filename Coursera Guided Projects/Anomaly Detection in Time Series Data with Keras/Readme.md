## Project
Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data with Keras
## Guidelines
In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

    Build an LSTM Autoencoder in Keras
    Detect anomalies with Autoencoders in time series data
    Create interactive charts and plots with Plotly and Seaborn

By the end of this course, you will be able to design and build an LSTM autoencoder in Keras to detect anomalies in the S&P 500 index and other time series data.

## Tasks
```
  Task 1: Project Overview and Import Libraries
  Task 2: Load and Inspect the S&P 500 Index Data
  Task 3: Data Preprocessing
  Task 4: Temporalize Data and Create Training and Test Splits
  Task 5: Build an LSTM Autoencoder
  Task 6: Train the Autoencoder
  Task 7: Plot Metrics and Evaluate the Model
  Task 8: Detect Anomalies in the S&P 500 Index Data
```
