## Project
Text Classification Using Word2Vec and LSTM on Keras
## Guidelines

In this project, you will learn how to do text classification use pre-trained Word Embeddings and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network using the Deep Learning Framework of Keras and Tensorflow in Python. We will be using Google Colab for writing our code and training the model using the GPU runtime provided by Google on the Notebook. We will first train a Word2Vec model and use its output in the embedding layer of our Deep Learning model LSTM which will then be evaluated for its accuracy and loss on unknown data and tested on few samples.

In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

    Preprocessing and Preparing Data for Word2Vec and LSTM Model
    Training and Testing the Word2Vec Model
    Building, Training & Testing the Word2Vec Model

By the end of this course, you will be able to create and train a text classification model using Word2Vec and LSTM on Keras.
