## Project
Part B - Statistical Data Visualization with Seaborn

## Guidelines
In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

    Produce and customize various chart types with Seaborn.
    Apply feature selection and feature extraction methods with scikit-learn.
    Build a boosted decision tree classifier with XGBoost.
    
## Tasks
    Task 1: Importing Libraries and Data (Part A)
    Task 2: Dropping Correlated Columns from Feature List
    Task 3: Classification using XGBoost (minimal feature selection)
    Task 4: Univariate Feature Selection
    Task 5: Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation
    Task 6: Plot CV Scores vs Number of Features Selected
    Task 7: Feature Extraction using Principal Component Analysis
