## Project
Dimensionality Reduction using an Autoencoder in Python 
## Guidelines
In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

     How to create a dummy dataset of high dimensionality, and reduce its dimensionality using PCA.
     How an autoencoder works, and how it is essentially a nuanced neural network.
     How to design, train, and evaluate an encoder from a trained autoencoder with scikit-learn.

By the end of this course, you will be able to use scikit-learn's Neural Network module to design, train, and evaluate an autoencoder using high dimensional data. Using this autoencoder, you will learn how to extract its encoder half for dimensionality reduction.

## Tasks
  ```
    Task 1: An introduction to the problem, as well as a summary of the imports we will need
    Task 2: Dataset creation and preprocessing relevant for our tasks
    Task 3: Using PCA as a baseline for model performance
    Task 4: Theory behind the autoencoder architecture, and how to train a model like this in scikit-learn
    Task 5: Reducing dimensionality using the encoder half of an autoencoder within scikit-learn (parts 1 & 2)
  ```
