## Project
Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow (Keras)
## Guidelines
In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:

    Learn to create, train and evaluate neural network models with TensorFlow and Keras.
    Understand the basics of neural networks.
    Learn to solve classification problems with the help of neural networks.

By the end of this course, you will be able to create a neural network model which will be able to classify images of hand written digits with a high degree of accuracy.

## Glossary

Here's a brief description of terms used in the Basic Image Classification hands on project:

    Keras - A high level API for neural networks which can run with TensorFlow, CNTK or Theano as its back end.
    TensorFlow - An open source platform and framework for creating, training, evaluating and deploying machine learning models.
    Neural Network - A Computing system that works as universal function approximator by learning correlations between given input and output data.
    MNIST - A dataset of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
    matplotlib - A plotting library for the Python programming language.
    One Hot Encoding - Encoding used for representation of categorical output labels. A valid label can only have a single high score in a group of classes, and all the other classes must have low scores.
    Vector - An object with a magnitude and a direction in a multi-dimensional space.
    Dense Layer - A neural network layer in which all the nodes are connected to all the nodes of the preceding layer.
    Activation Function - Typically desired to be a non-linear function which can serve output for various nodes in neural networks.
    Loss Function - A function that computes some measure of difference between a model's predicted values and true labels given in a dataset.
    Optimizer - An algorithm that aims to minimize output of a loss function by updating parameters of a model that is being trained.
