# Deep Learning/ Machine Learning Projects

This repository is created for general understanding coding and its related projects on machine learning and deep learning topics. These projects involve working on machine learning and deep learning concepts using Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow libraries using Python Code. This repository is updated on regular basis dependent upon project studies. Some of the projects are undertaken from [Deep Learning with Python by Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/deep-learning-with-python/), from Coursera guided projects, and Kaggle.com.
